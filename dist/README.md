This project is divided into 2 parts. 

**Part 1** covers optimization of the **index.html** file to a point that Google PageSpeed Insights gives the page a score of at least 90 on both mobile and desktop devices.

**Part 2** covers optimization of the **pizza.html** file by making the necessary changes to **main.js**. The end goal is to achieve **60fps** (frames per second).

The project is also meant to emphasize the use of build tools, which are an incredibly useful way to automate certain tasks and achieve more efficient optimizations for a developer. This project utilized **Gulp**.
